# About Me

I'm a recent graduate from Virginia Tech, having taken several courses in mathematics and computer science. I've coded in several languages, including Java, C (POSIX and Win32), C++, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Rust.
I have covered several topics as detailed below, but my most passionate interests are:

- Cryptography (low-level primitives and applied cryptography, i.e. OpenSSL/libcrypto)
- Kernel space development in Linux and Windows, as well as embedded C development (FreeRTOS, bare metal)
- Network traffic analysis (libpcap, Scapy) on protocols such as HTTP, TLS, and broadly TCP/IP
- Process tracing (ptrace, Frida)
- Concurrent programming (multithreading, async/await pattern and futures)
- Network programming (at the socket level)
- Foreign function interfaces (calling C/C++ code from other languages and environments, including WebAssembly and iOS and Android apps)
- Unit testing, code coverage, CI/CD (GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions)

In general, I enjoy low level development (C, C++, Rust, assembly) for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. I frequently write Python scripts for prototyping. I'm also very familiar with the Linux terminal, including commands like `curl`, `ssh`, `tcpdump`, `lsof`, and others.
Virtualization technologies interest me, including virtual machines (VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU) and containers (Docker).
